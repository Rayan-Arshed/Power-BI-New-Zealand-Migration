# Power BI New Zealand Migration

## Overview
A task to build a dashboard in Power BI using a dataset of migration records to and out of New Zealand from 1979 to 2016 to depict the change over time, and the proportion of where arrivals are coming from.

## Project Goals
The goal of this project was to take a look at this dataset, and analyse it to see the difference in migration patterns to and from New Zealand over time, in case there are any interesting observations that could be made. I set out to create a line graph to depict the trend over time, and wanted to experiment with map visuals in Power BI.

## Tools and Technologies Used
### Power BI
- KPI figures
- Filters
- Bar Chart
- Tree Map
- Line chart
- Map 

## Strong Points of my Work
- Creating a map chart that shows the breakdown for migration per year with varying sized bubbles for each country
- Creating a unique looking tree map to visualize the change in people by the size of the chart compared to each other
- Breaking down the arrivals on a bar graph by filtering and grouping by continent
